# Sayonika Server

This repository contains the Sayonika server code.

Sayonika uses a Microservice layout for serving its mod listing. This means, each component has to be deployed individually but increases fault tolerance.

Sayonika server is built with Express and :heart: and runs along with the ORY Authentication backend.

## Running

Sayonika requires Node.js, and TypeScript to run. Go to [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org) to get a copy.

Then, clone the repository and run `npm install`.

## Contributing

We use TypeScript for coding the server. You are required to follow the coding style set on our repository.

We rely on [ORY](https://github.com/ory) for the Gateway system. Please consult their repository
if you find something off on the gateway, not here.

The full contribution guide can be found [here](CONTRIBUTING.md)
